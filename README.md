# SSA-Based Adaptive Infrared-Visible Image Fusion for Ink Enhancement in Ancient Bamboo Slips

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the paper "SSA-Based Adaptive Infrared-Visible Image Fusion for Ink Enhancement in Ancient Bamboo Slips". The research proposes an adaptive infrared-visible image fusion method based on Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) specifically designed for enhancing ink traces in ancient bamboo slips (Jiandu).

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- Develop an SSA-based adaptive image fusion algorithm
- Achieve effective fusion of infrared and visible light images
- Enhance faded or blurred ink traces in ancient bamboo slips
- Provide technical support for Jiandu digital research and preservation

## 🔬 Key Contributions

- **Dual-path Attention Network for Differentiated Feature Enhancement**: Introduces a novel SSA module that adaptively selects spatial locations to precisely enhance infrared ink signals while suppressing noise.

- **Multi-scale Information Measurement Strategy for Adaptive Fusion**: Distinct norms for different modalities dynamically evaluate multi-scale information, enabling intelligent weight allocation to balance ink clarity and material detail representation.

- **Unsupervised Loss Function Tailored for Jiandu Characteristics**: A label-free loss function uses adaptive weights to guide optimization, ensuring the fusion result preserves key structural and pixel information from the source images while maintaining the original visual fidelity of the artifact.

## 📊 Experimental Results

Experimental results demonstrate that this method surpasses existing approaches in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics, offering more effective tool support for Jiandu digital research.
